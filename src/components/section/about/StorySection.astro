    title="🐧 How I got into programming - My mom forced me"
    text="Yep, you heard that right. So a little backstory, in 6th grade I was an avid gamer. I gamed almost-always-everyday, and she was quite mad I play too much game. So she put me into a Python course, thinking 'At least if you play games, you can make one yourself' and now I'm here both gaming and coding 💀🐧"
